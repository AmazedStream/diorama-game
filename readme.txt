Compatibility test v0.0.2
=========================

This is not to test features, it is to test the demo runs at all on a variety
of hardware. If you have problems let me know on www.twitch.tv/robtheswan

It may have bugs, it may run slow, but I'm only really interested in if it
crashes or has rendering bugs!


Known Bugs
==========

* If you zoom too quickly to the edge of the world you can get stuck
* It doesn't remember your world position when saving a level
* You can place blocks where you are standing and get stuck. Dig!
* Meshes update slower than collision. You can walk in blocks you just destroyed.
* Crosshair doesn't dissappear in pause mode
* Delete World option doesn't always delete it fully! Delete it again!
* Enter key on Numeric Keypad doesn't work for text entry fields.
* Holding jump down means you can stick to the underside of blocks.


Controls
========

WASD = movement
SPACE = jump
SHIFT + WASD = move (very) quickly)
LEFT MOUSE = destroy blocks
RIGHT MOUSE = place BRICK
